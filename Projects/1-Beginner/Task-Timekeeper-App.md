### Project Name
**Task Timekeeper** â€“ An app to manage and track daily tasks with time monitoring features

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

### Description
Task Timekeeper is an application that allows users to create, edit, and delete daily tasks, with an additional feature to track how much time is spent on each task. Users can set target durations for each task, and the app will track the time spent working on them. The app will notify the user when they exceed the time limit they set, helping them manage their time more efficiently.

### Features
- **Add new tasks**: Users can create new tasks by entering a title, description, and setting a target completion time.
- **Edit tasks**: Users can update existing tasks.
- **Delete tasks**: Users can remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Start/Pause task timer**: Users can start or stop the timer while working on tasks.
- **Track time spent**: Display the duration of time spent on each task.
- **Time limit alert**: Notify users when they have spent more time on a task than their target duration.
- **Filter tasks by status**: Filter tasks into categories such as ongoing, completed, or not started yet.
- **Task history**: Keep a record of completed tasks along with the time spent on them.

### Bonus Features
- **Daily/Weekly statistics**: Show a summary of time spent on tasks or categories each day or week.
- **Calendar synchronization**: Integrate with Google Calendar or other calendar apps to schedule and track tasks.
- **Location-based reminders**: Send reminders to start or complete tasks when users arrive at specific locations.
- **Dark/Light mode**: Allow users to switch between dark and light themes.

### Technologies
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for a basic web app)
- Front-end framework like React or Vue.js (for extended features)
- LocalStorage or IndexedDB (for local data storage)
- PWA (Progressive Web App) to allow offline access

### API Dependencies
None required for the basic version, but integration with external calendar APIs (e.g., Google Calendar API) can be added for bonus features.

### Development Steps
1. **Build a basic UI** with a task list and form for adding and editing tasks.
2. **Implement the task timer** that starts and stops time tracking for each task.
3. **Add local storage** to save tasks and their time history.
4. **Implement notifications** when time exceeds the task's target.
5. **Bonus**: Add synchronization and statistical features to enhance functionality.
